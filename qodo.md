## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### System Context
```
[User Browser] → [Interactive Web Application] → [Local Media Assets]
                        ↓                              ↓
                [JavaScript Engine]              [Audio/Image Files]
                        ↓
                [Animation & State Management]
```

### Key Components
- **UI Controller** - Manages DOM interactions, theme switching, and responsive behavior
- **Particle Engine** - Dynamic heart animation system with performance optimization
- **Gallery Manager** - Lightbox functionality with keyboard navigation and image preloading
- **Audio Controller** - Background music management with autoplay fallbacks and user controls
- **Timeline Renderer** - Interactive relationship milestone visualization
- **Counter Engine** - Real-time date calculations with smooth number animations
- **Notification System** - User feedback with elegant popup messages and easter eggs
- **Theme Manager** - Dark/light mode switching with localStorage persistence

### Data Flow
1. User loads application → Loading screen with animated hearts appears
2. JavaScript initializes all component systems (particles, counter, gallery, audio)
3. CSS applies responsive theming based on saved user preferences
4. User interactions trigger component-specific handlers (gallery, messages, theme toggle)
5. Real-time counter updates every second with animated number changes
6. Particle system continuously generates and cleans up floating heart animations

## 🔄 Common Workflows

### User Experience Journey
1. **Loading Experience** - Animated heart loader with "Cargando amor..." message
2. **Main Interface** - Floating heart particles with romantic header and gradient background
3. **Photo Gallery** - Click any image to open full-screen lightbox with navigation
4. **Interactive Elements** - Theme toggle (🌙/☀️), music controls (🎵), romantic messages (💌)
5. **Timeline Exploration** - Visual relationship milestones with special moments
6. **Real-time Counter** - Live countdown/countup showing days, hours, minutes, seconds together

**Code path:** `index.html` → `styles.css` (theming) → `script.js` (interactions) → `assets` (media)

### Content Customization Workflow
1. **Update Photos** - Replace 1.jpg through 5.jpg with new images (recommended: max 1MB each)
2. **Modify Messages** - Edit `mensajesRomanticos` array in script.js for new romantic messages
3. **Change Timeline** - Update timeline-moments section in index.html with new dates/events
4. **Customize Colors** - Modify CSS custom properties in styles.css `:root` section

## 📈 Performance & Scale

### Performance Considerations
- **Particle System** - Intelligent cleanup prevents memory leaks, mobile optimization reduces particle count
- **Lazy Loading** - Images load only when visible using IntersectionObserver API
- **Hardware Acceleration** - CSS transforms use GPU for smooth 60fps animations
- **Efficient DOM** - Minimal DOM manipulation with event delegation and optimized selectors

### Monitoring & Optimization
- **Animation Performance** - Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth particle updates
- **Memory Management** - Automatic particle cleanup and event listener removal
- **Mobile Optimization** - Reduced particle count and simplified animations on smaller screens
- **Loading Strategy** - Progressive enhancement with core content accessible without JavaScript

## 🚨 Things to Be Careful About

### 🔒 Security Considerations
- **Personal Content** - Contains intimate photos and personal messages - consider privacy when sharing
- **Client-Side Only** - All processing happens in browser, no server-side vulnerabilities
- **No Data Collection** - Privacy-focused design with no external tracking or analytics

### 💝 Content Sensitivity
- **Relationship Dates** - Counter is hardcoded to June 12, 2025 - update in script.js if needed
- **Spanish Language** - All content is in Spanish, targeting specific audience
- **Personal Photos** - Images are personal and should be handled with appropriate privacy considerations
- **Audio Autoplay** - Browser restrictions may prevent automatic music playback

### ⚡ Technical Considerations
- **Browser Compatibility** - Requires modern browser with ES6+, CSS Grid, and IntersectionObserver support
- **Mobile Performance** - Particle animations may impact battery life on older mobile devices
- **File Sizes** - Large images or audio files can slow loading times (current MP3: 9.3MB)
- **Audio Licensing** - Ensure proper rights for any background music used

### 🎨 Customization Notes
- **Date Dependencies** - Multiple date references throughout code need coordinated updates
- **Color Theming** - CSS custom properties system requires understanding of variable inheritance
- **Animation Timing** - Particle system performance depends on device capabilities
- **Responsive Breakpoints** - Mobile layout changes at 768px and 480px - test thoroughly
